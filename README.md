# Neural Network in JavaScript with Deeplearn.js

Use Case: Learning best color matches for an improved web accessibility.

This example project demonstrates how [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) may be used to solve a binary classification problem.

It uses [deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org/) to predict accessible font colors based on background colors.

* `git clone git@github.com:javascript-machine-learning/color-accessibility-neural-network-deeplearnjs.git`
* `cd color-accessibility-neural-network-deeplearnjs`
